# Credit-Card-Approvlal
The dataset includes credit card transactions performed by European cardholders in September 2013. We have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions in our dataset of transactions that took place over the course of two days. The dataset is very skewed, with frauds making up 0.172% of all transactions in the positive class.
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individualâ€™s credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Fortunately, this task can be automated with machine learning, and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do. Predicting whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on values of feature variables is a supervised machine learning classification task. We plan to use the logistic regression model for this problem
